How to Solve ?
-------------------

- Install aircrack package with `sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng`

- Use aircrack command with the pcap and wordlist given `aircrack-ng TNB-CAFE.cap -w password_list_v2.txt `

- "C:\windows\temp\hdoor.exe": This is the path to the executable file "hdoor.exe" on a Windows system. It is enclosed in double quotes, which is common when dealing with file paths containing spaces.

- -hbs 192.168.9.1-192.168.9.50: These are command-line options for the "hdoor.exe" program. It appears to be specifying a range of IP addresses from 192.168.9.1 to 192.168.9.50 using the -hbs option. This range might be used for scanning or interacting with devices within that IP range.

- Search for the MD5 Hash files
